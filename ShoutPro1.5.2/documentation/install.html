<div style="font-size:10pt">
<p><b>Installation Instructions:</b> </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Download the script.</strong>
		<ul><li>If you're reading this, you're already one-fifth of the way there!</li></ul></li>
    <li><strong>Edit two config files.</strong>
		<ul><li>Open up the file "config.php" in a text-editing program 
      and configure all of the settings to your liking. Each setting has a description 
      of how it should be set and what it is.</li>
		  <li>Styles for ShoutPro are stored in CSS files in the &quot;themes/&quot; folder. You can specify which theme file you want to use in config.php. If you know CSS, you can edit &quot;default.css&quot; or the other themes included to customize the look of your shoutbox. </li>
	  </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Upload to your web server.</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Open up your favorite FTP client, connect to your web site, and create a folder for your new shoutbox. </li>
        <li>Upload all of the files and folders found in this 
        zip to the folder you just created.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Set a few file permissions. </strong>
      <ul>
	  	<li>If your web server is not running a variation of Unix or Linux, skip this step.</li>
		<li>chmod-ing is a process that allows ShoutPro to edit the files in its directory.  If you do not know how to chmod, try right clicking on a file on your web site through your FTP program.  Look for "Permissions", "Attributes", "Properties", or something like that.  If you see a window pop up with three rows of checkboxes (for Read, Write, and Execute) as well as three columns (for Owner / User, Group, and World / Public), then you're set.</li>
        <li>chmod the shoutbox folder 777 (make it readable, writable, 
          and executable by everyone).</li>
        <li>chmod the folder &quot;lists&quot; inside the shoutbox folder 777 
          (make it readable, writable, and executable by everyone).</li>
        <li>chmod the file "lists/names.php" 
          666 (make it readable and writable by everyone). If problems arise chmod it 777 
          instead.</li>
        <li>chmod the file "shouts.php" 666 (make it readable 
          and writable by everyone). If problems arise chmod it 777 instead.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>You're done! Shout! </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Open the file "shoutbox.php" in your browser. Try 
          posting a few messages and see if it works. If it doesn't, make sure all of your permissions from step 4 were done correctly, and that your web server supports PHP. </li>
        <li>To put your new shoutbox on your site, just create 
          an IFRAME with it. Here is a sample IFRAME code:           </li>
  <blockquote>
    <p> &lt;IFRAME frameborder="0" width="150" height="300" 
      src="shoutpro/shoutbox.php"&gt;&lt;/IFRAME&gt;<br>
		Make sure the "src" attribute is pointing to the 
      correct file and the width is what you specified in the configuration 
      file.</p>
	</blockquote>
      <li>That's it! ShoutPro should now be working correctly. 
        If you have any questions just post on our <a href="http://www.shoutpro.com/boards/" target="_blank">message 
          boards.</a></li>
    </ul></li></ol>
